**Data Explaination:**

1) Data is recieved monthly from the Santa Rita Precipitation Website (located here: ---).
2) -9999 values are replaced in the dataset with interpolated data. Inverse Distance Weighting (IDW) interpolation was utilized for the Santa Rita Experimental Range (SRER), with the SRER boundary as the extent.
3) Long-term monthly averages were calculated for April, May, and June of 1955 and January of 1959 as replacement interpolation failed due to lack of full-data.
4) Completed manipulated, estimated, and interpolated data is utilized to create the visualizations on the web application.
